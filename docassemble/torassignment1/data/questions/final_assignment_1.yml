  #The progress and navigation bar seeks to improve user experience. By providing a clear path on the number of specific numbered steps left to completion, it sets users' expectation on how much time (which is also mentioned in Introduction page) and effort is required. It also shows the tasks completed and the user's current location within the process. This function would allow users to quickly comprehend the logical flow of the interview, and reduce user abandonment.

  Sorry, you do not qualify for legal aid under the Legal Aid Bureau.
subquestion: | # To improve user experience, applicants would be provided with specific reasons to detail why they are not eligible for legal aid. This ensures that applicants have a clearer understanding of the legal aid process under Legal Aid Bureau, while allowing the applicants to be more cognisant of these requirements (especially since many legal aid schemes share like requirements on income and property etc). Hence, applicants would not be left in a lurch when they then choose to decide their next course of action from other available options.
  Under the Means Test, applicants must own only one property to qualify for assistance.

  You are eligible for legal aid under the Legal Aid Bureau. 
subquestion: |
  Please proceed to click "Continue" to download the letter of eligibility.
  
  Before submitting the letter to Legal Aid Bureau (via e-mail or post), please remember to attach relevant supporting documents. This includes (1) documents relating to your property-related information, (2) documents which show your total amount of savings and non-CPF investments, and (3) payslips or forms which can assist in verifying your per capital monthly household income.
attachment: # Taking into account Legal Bureau Aid's multi-staged process, by being able to generate a preliminary document to show that an applicant is deemed eligible under the Means Test (subject to corroboration with supporting materials), this can greatly help to expedite the process for applicants to seek legal aid. This is especially so given that lawyers at LAB now merely have to check the supporting documents against what is recorded thereunder in the letter of eligibility, hence ensuring that completion of the interview is a meaningful affair (rather than merely telling the applicant that they are "eligible" and stopping at that).
